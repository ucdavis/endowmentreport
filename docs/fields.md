# Fields
{: .no_toc }
This page will give you an overview of the different fields (columns) in the data and what their purpose is in the final report. 

Some fields are _informational_ and will not impact the report. _Printable_ fields, however, will have an impact on the final report. In Airtable, printable fields will be marked by a double asterisk: `Allocation**`

## Printable Fields
Printable fields are denoted by an asterisk on Airtable. 

### Fund Name
This field contains the endowment fund’s complete name. This is the name that is printed on the **financial report.**

### Salutation & Spouse Salutation
Salutations appear in the opening letter of the report. By default we utilize the donor’s nickname. Where a nickname wasn’t available, the donor’s first name is being utilized. For organizations, we utilize _friends_ as the salutation.

By default the female name will appear first, followed by the male. If you would like to change the order, or request a spouse NOT be stewarded, please [request a change](https://ucdavis.github.io/endowmentreport//docs/change){:target="_blank"}
```
Dear Sally & Phil,
Dear Friends,
```

### Email Addresses
This is the email address that we have on file for the stewardee. Please ensure it is correct, as this is where they will receive the instructions to access their endowment report. 

If we do not have an email on file for a stewardee, please help us obtain as many as possible.

### Primary Stewardee & Spouse Name
**These fields will not appear on the digital report but will only be used for the few stewardees who receive a printed copy.**

The preferred mail names are printed on the **envelope** and follow specific formatting. 
```swift
Mrs. Sally Mustang
Mr. Phil Mustang
```

If the `Spouse Preferred Mail Name` field is blank, then the report will be addressed only to the primary donor.
