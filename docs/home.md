# Introduction
Every year we report on the performance of endowment funds and their impact to the university. To ensure their accuracy we strive to ensure data accuracy and integrity. This year, we are taking additional cleanup steps to ensure this becomes an easier and quicker process in years to come.

This site will guide you through all aspects of the endowment preliminary listing. 

The Airtable-based preliminary listing process introduced last year remains in place. However we have taken steps to shorten the workflow to request changes.


## Summary of Changes for 2020
This year, we are implementing a few changes to the preliminary listing process:

## Airtable
Instead of using Excel spreadsheets, we will use [Airtable](https://airtable.com) to provide you the relevant data for your review. Airtable is a lightweight web application. Rather than keeping track of a spreadsheet, it will be available tIt is more intuitive and easier to use. And we will guide you through everything you need to know.

## Endowment Cleanup
There are XXXX endowment funds without stewardees. This year we are beginning a multi-year effort to clean up the stewardship of a lot of these funds. Given the amount of funds, and the amount of data to review for funds with active stewardees, this year we will begin only with UC Davis Foundation funds.
