# Introduction
Every year we report on the performance of endowment funds and their impact to the university. To ensure their accuracy we strive to ensure data accuracy and integrity. This year, we are taking additional cleanup steps to ensure this becomes an easier and quicker process in years to come.

This site will guide you through all aspects of the endowment preliminary listing. 

The Airtable-based preliminary listing process introduced last year remains in place. However we have taken steps to shorten the workflow to request changes.


## Summary of Changes for 2023
There aren't many changes from last year, except that we have added unstewarded funds to the Preliminary Listing Airtable data. Please make an effort to find a stewardee for those funds when applicable.

## Airtable
Instead of using Excel spreadsheets, we will use [Airtable](https://airtable.com) to provide you the relevant data for your review. Airtable is a lightweight web application. Rather than keeping track of a spreadsheet, Airtable is more intuitive and easier to use. And we will guide you through everything you need to know.

## Endowment Cleanup
There are 393 endowment funds without stewardees. We are working on a multi-year effort to clean up the stewardship of a lot of these funds. Those are indicated by "UNSTD" in the AIS ID column in Airtable. If you know of any entity that should receive a report for that fund, please do let us know by filling out the "Request a Change " form.
