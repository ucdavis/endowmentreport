# Views
{: .no_toc }
On the surface, Airtable looks like a regular spreadsheet. However, it provides us a much better way to personalize the data for you. It will give you the subset of the data that is most relevant to you and allow you to manipulate it whichever way you need. Most importantly any changes you make to how the data is organized will _not_ affect anyone else. 

A view is simply a different way of looking at the same underlying data. Because there are so many reports mailed out, it is easier if you only see the data that is relevant to you.

So far we have created views for every school & unit. For schools with much higher number of reports to be reviewed, we have created additional views. We have also created views specific for DOs. 

We believe these will cover most of your needs. However, if you need a more customized view, Airtable provides tools within the view to filter, group, and sort the data.

> Note: You DO NOT have to use the tools described below. But you can use them if you wish. Changes you make here WILL NOT affect anyone else. 
> If you would like a customized view, simply **_[reach out](mailto:dahanson@ucdavis.edu)_** to us or fill out **_[this form](https://airtable.com/shrnCCfY3TiYH2kPS){:target="_blank"}_** and we would be happy to create it for you.

## Airtable Toolbar
When you enter any of the Airtable views provided to you, you will see a toolbar with options to filter, group, and sort the data.

## Group
Grouping the data allows you to arrange the data based on specific criteria. For example, you are looking at all the funds within a school, but you want to organize them by RM. Simply click on `group` and select the field to group them by (`Relationship Manager`). Once grouped, you can collapse or expand all the groups to navigate more easily. 

> To see this in practice, take a look at the view titled `All Donors - By RM`. This view contains all records where the donor has an RM, and then groups them based on that RM. 

For more information on group records, check [Airtable’s Documentation](https://support.airtable.com/hc/en-us/articles/221747587-Guide-to-grouped-records){:target="_blank"}

## Filter
Airtable provides a powerful filter function built around various logical operators. To understand how they work, please check [Airtable's Documentation](https://support.airtable.com/hc/en-us/articles/360003695134-Guide-to-filters-and-record-visibility){:target="_blank"}

## Sort
Sorting data works just as you would expect. Simply click on Sort and select the field you wish to sort by. Once sorter, you can adjust the order (Ascending/Descending). 

For more information on sorting, check [Airtable’s Documentation](https://support.airtable.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016471593-Guide-to-sorting-and-record-order){:target="_blank"}
