# Endowment Cleanup

## Overview
This year we are continuing with the endowment cleanup process we started last year. We are focusing on a subset of Regents endowment funds and FFEs.

Please review these funds and determine whether a stewardee can be added. In many cases, it will be a previous stewardeeâ€™s next of kin.

## Access & Navigation
The process for endowment clean up works the same way as with preliminary listing. You will access a separate Airtable view containing all the data.

Links to these views can be found in the Airtable [table of contents](https://airtable.com/appsCGrs4v1jVJWld/shrdZr5COpQCTNwhm){:target="_blank"}

## Fields
As this is a much simpler process, there are fewer fields to consider.
- Allocation Number
- Fund Name
- School/Unit
- Department
- UCOP Allocation (`PG` denotes a planned gift)

## Adding a Stewardee
To add a stewardee, simply click the URL to access a form. As with preliminary listing, the first few questions are reference fields. Please do not edit them.

Simply select the action you would like to take and add details in the box below. Available actions are:
- Add a stewardee
- Fund does not require stewardship
- Other

If you are adding a stewardee, please include the following:
- AIS ID
- Name
- Should spouse be stewarded (yes/no)

If the fund does not require stewardship, please explain why.
