### Are endowment reports only sent to donors once they complete their pledge?
Donors will receive an endowment report even if the fund isn't fully endowed yet. 
Funds in the _planned gift_ (PG) stage will not produce a financial report, however the donor will receive the brochure and letter. If the fund already has funds but is either _building to endowment_ (BTE) or has funds being _added to principal_ (ATP), the donor will receive a financial report showing the current value of the fund. 

### Do I have to submit the same change for a donor multiple times if they are receiving multiple reports?
If the donor is receiving reports for multiple funds, and you are requesting a change, you only need to do so once. 

Example: Donor who receives 8 funds recently moved. You only need to update the address for ONE of the funds the donor receives, not all 8. We will consolidate all the information and make sure all changes are made adequately.

### If a donor has funds with Regents & Foundation, will they receive a consolidated report?
Donors will receive access to their personalized Ovrture site. Within each site, they will have access to financial reports for each allocation they are the stewardee for. The financial report will identify whether it's a Regents or Foundation fund.
