# Create an Account
The first time you enter Airtable you will be prompted to create an account. This is a one-time step but it is crucial to ensure only the right people are seeing the data.

Once you open Airtable, you will see the following screen prompting you to log in. Simply click on **Sign up for free.**

After this, fill out the screen asking your name & email. Create a safe password, and make sure you **use your @ucdavis.edu email** otherwise, you will not have access.
