# Requesting a Change
In previous years, a questionnaire was required for each record. This year, we will only require you to fill out a form if a change is needed.

If the record is correct, simply move on to the next.

We have built a simple form that allows you to input the change needed. This form will automatically notify us of changes, and we can follow up with you if needed. 

To ensure this system works, and we can trust the integrity of the data moving forward, it is **critical** that you **update Advance** with any changes needed. 

Some changes, or special handling considerations do not need to be updated. However, if someone has moved, or if there is a clear error in the data, please **update Advance** to ensure the record is correct. 

> Note: When we compile the reports, we will re-pull data from Advance. **If the changes are not made in Advance, they will not make it to the final report.** It is critical that you update Advance. 

> If you have questions about how to make a change, or are unable to do so, you will be able to add any relevant details in the Airtable form.

## The Change Form
The second column in each Airtable view contains a link to a form to make a change to the data. Each URL is customized for each record & will pre-fill several fields for you.

Once you enter the form you will see several pre-filled reference fields. These allow us to keep track of what changes go where, but it saves you the time it would take to fill this out. Use these to confirm the information but **do not edit them.**

Under *type of change* please select the change required and then add any relevant details in the box below.

If we don't have emails in file for the stewardees, there will be a space to add an email if you have it. 

## Hand Delivery
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the transition to digital reports, we will not provide any reports to be hand delivered to donors. 

However, we will provide you with all the needed information to be able to walk donors through their report.

Should you have any questions with the form, please [send us an email][1] and we will be happy to help out.
