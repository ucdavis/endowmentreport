# Airtable
In previous years we have used Excel spreadsheets to provide you with all the data needing review. This year we have reduced the amount of data to only the most relevant pieces of information. We have also implemented a new system to replace the spreadsheets.

You should have received links to access the data. If so, [create an account][1]{:target="_blank"}. If you have not, please use this [form][2]{:target="_blank"} to request access.

> Note: This video was created with the original Airtable preliminary listing. There may be some minor differences as to how things look like now.

## Process Overview
Using the links provided to you, you will be able to access the data for all the reports that will be printed and mailed to donors. 

Each link will take you to a different [view][3]{:target="\_blank"} of the data. A view is simply a selection of records based on specific criteria, i.e. Funds corresponding to one department. 

Here you can review all the data. If you need to make a change, there is a form attached to each record. If no changes are needed, no action is required from you.

Should you require a change to a record, we ask that you **update Advance** in addition to submitting this form. Keeping Advance updated is the best way to ensure long-term data integrity and make this an easier process in years to come. 

## Getting Started
To get started, simply open one of the links provided to you. Once open, you will be prompted to [create an account][4]{:target="\_blank"}. Once inside, you will see the data relevant to that view (whether by department or another grouping). It will tell you how many records there are, and provide you with the link to the form to update the record. 

On the surface, Airtable looks like a regular spreadsheet. However, it provides us a much better way to personalize the data for you. It will give you the subset of the data that is most relevant to you and allow you to manipulate it whichever way you need. Most importantly any changes you make to how the data is organized will _not_ affect anyone else. 

## Navigating Airtable
Once you are inside and can see the data in spreadsheet form. The first two columns are frozen to make it more easy to keep track of where you are. 

There are two ways to navigate, you can scroll sideways (easier on a laptop with a trackpad), or you can use your arrow keys. Simply click on any cell and navigate with the arrow keys like you would in Excel.

If you donâ€™t wish to scroll, simply press `space`, and the record will expand into a card. The top left of the card contains buttons to navigate to the next or previous record, and the link to the change form is easily accessible.
