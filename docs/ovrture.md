# Ovrture
This year we are using Ovrture, a digital platform to develop and distribute digital endowment reports for our donors. Digital reports will create a more interactive experience for stewardees and it will allow us to add greater personalization at scale.

## Planned Features
These are some of the features and capabilities that Ovrture reports will have this year. Please keep in mind that some of these are subject to change.
- Full printing capability (both the full report & financials only)
- Video messages & introductions
- Historical fund data
- Automated charting of fund data across time (dependent on data availability, not all funds will have this.)

## How an Ovrture Report Works
With Ovrture we will create personalized sites for each stewardee. Within that site, stewardees will see a variety of content: Stories, pictures, videos, and their financial reports. If a stewardee receives reports for multiple funds, they will all appear in the same site. They will also have the option to print out the financials if they wish.

## Access
As usual, endowment reports will be reaching stewardees at the latest on November 1st. All stewardees will receive an email with a link to their personalized site as well as the passcode to access it.

We will also make reports available to development officers and all the schools and units so that you can see exactly what the donors see. 

Because this system is entirely digital we will rely heavily on email address availability. Please help us in obtaining email addresses for stewardees who we don't have emails in file.
