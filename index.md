# Introduction
Every year we report on the performance of endowment funds and their impact to the university. To ensure their accuracy we strive to ensure data accuracy and integrity. This year, we are taking additional cleanup steps to ensure this becomes an easier and quicker process in years to come.

This site will guide you through all aspects of the endowment preliminary listing. 

The Airtable-based preliminary listing process remains in place. However, we have taken steps to shorten the workflow to request changes.

## 2023 Updates
### Email Address Collection
Given the transition to digital reports, stewardees will receive access instructions via email. As such, we continue to focus in this year's preliminary listing on obtaining email addresses for stewardees. In the change forms on Airtable you will be prompted to add an email address for a stewardee if we do not have one on file. 

We obtained many new email addresses over the last years. However, we still do not have emails on file for many recipients.

Given that the majority of donors are receiving digital reports, we are not including mailing addresses in the preliminary listing. If a record you are reviewing has no email addresses on file, please ensure that their mailing address in Advance is correct as that is where their printed report will be sent.


### Endowment Cleanup
We are continuing the endowment cleanup process. You are encouraged to use the Donors without an RM as well as Funds without a stewardee. Funds without a stewardee will have â€“UNSTD as part of their identifier code. You will find a link to these funds in the Airtable [table of contents](https://airtable.com/app26mTpOBkuIbM93/shrBol9ZdJIR0f5HL){:target="\_blank"}

Please make an effort to identify a stewardee. If a specific fund is not to be stewarded, please let us know why by submitting a "make a change" form and following the proper procedures.

### Deceased Stewardees
We have removed most deceased stewardees as report recipients. When we could find a spouse, they were added to the fund. However, if someone else should be stewarded (or if the descendant is not in Advance), please [fill out a change form](https://ucdavis.github.io/endowmentreport//docs/change){:target="\_blank"} in Airtable and ensure Advance is updated.
